    excerpt: >
      I’m a Master’s student in Robotics, Systems & Control at ETH Zürich, with a background in Mechanical Engineering from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.mech.ntua.gr/en/) (NTUA). I completed my master’s thesis at the [Autonomous Robots Lab](https://www.autonomousrobotslab.com/) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) (NTNU) under the joint supervision of [Kostas Alexis](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/konstantinos.alexis) (NTNU) and [Ioannis Poulakakis](https://www.mech.ntua.gr/en/poulakakis) (NTUA). After my undergraduate studies, I worked at [iKnowHow](https://www.iknowhow.com/) as a Junior Robotics Engineer developing a robotic welding platform. 
      Outside of robotics, I enjoy hiking, basketball, board games, video games and movies.

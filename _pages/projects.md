    title: "Modeling, Simulation and Control of a novel robotic leg"
    excerpt: >
      Developed a simulation and control framework for a prototype robotic leg using C++, ROS and Gazebo. Verified the framework using comparisons with MATLAB Simscape models and analytical calculations

feature_row_2:
  - image_path: /assets/images/robots_stock_image.jpg
    title: "Design and manufacturing of a robotic worm"
    excerpt: >
      Designed a modular underwater robotic worm using Solidworks and manufactured a 3D printed prototype. Programmed microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi) for motion control and sensor data collection

feature_row_3:

    title: "Defects Detection"
    excerpt: >
      This paper addresses the modeling and attitude control of jumping quadrupeds in low-gravity environments. First, a convex decomposition procedure is presented to generate high-accuracy and low-cost collision geometries for quadrupeds performing agile maneuvers.

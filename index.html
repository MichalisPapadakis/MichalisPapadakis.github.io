<h1 align = "center"> About Me </h1>

Hi, my name is Michalis Papadakis. I am currently a Master's Student studying Robotics at ETH Zurich. 
My research interests lie at the intersection of dynamics, control theory, and optimization, aiming to
answer the following question: How can model-based approaches enable robots to move and
perform dynamic tasks in their environment efficiently, safely, and robustly? Specifically, I am
interested in optimal and nonlinear control techniques, focusing on informed formulations that
capture essential dynamics and leverage system properties while remaining mathematically well-conditioned 
for tractability in real-world applications.
If you are interested in discussing my work, or regarding profesionnal opportunities, feel free
